## Sally Anthony Taylor

**September 24, 1938 - June 5, 2020**

Sally Anthony Taylor peacefully passed from her earthly-home in Ames, IA to her heavenly-home on June 5, 2020--culminating a wonderful and rich lifetime of experiences.

Sally Anthony was born September 24, 1938 to Ray & Marion Anthony in Norseland, MN. She graduated from high school at Bethany Lutheran College in Mankato, MN in 1956. She attended Iowa State University-- graduating with her BSc degree in Textiles & Clothing in 1960, and her MSc degree in Textiles & Clothing, with a minor in education, in 1964. On July 4, 1964, she joined Donald C. Taylor in marriage at the Norseland Lutheran Church in MN.

Sally is survived by her husband Don; their three children: Stacia (Brian) Steward in Ames, IA, Chris (Catherine) in Brookfield, WI, & Terry (Nicole) in Piedmont, CA; eight grandchildren--Timothy, Benjamin, Simeon, & Micah Steward (IA), Topher & Stephanie Taylor (WI), and Christian & Caroline Taylor (CA); her sister Joy (Fred) Struck in St Peter, MN, and her sister-in-law Dotty Anthony in Norseland, MN. She was preceded in death by her parents, Ray & Marion Anthony; her brother, Larry Anthony; & an infant son, Timothy.
Sally & Don were greatly blessed to live their 80+ years in roughly equal "20-year" segments: growing up in their respective homes; one-half their professional careers in Asia--in Lebanon, India, Indonesia, & Malaysia;  the other half in Brookings, SD; & the final segment of retirement in Ames.

Sally had a heart to serve others and was an accomplished cook, baker, & seamstress. Her latter accomplishments included sewing Don's university graduation-gown & hood and Stacia's wedding & bridesmaids' dresses. She deeply loved her children and was effective in teaching them to be persons of character & talent.

Prior to having children, Sally taught elementary school at the American Community School in Beirut, Lebanon and later at the International School of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She was a wonderful stay-at-home Mom and volunteered at church and in the community.
