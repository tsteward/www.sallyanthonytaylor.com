If you would like to visit with Don and children, please sign up for a specific time slot to visit with the family to share your condolences and memories of Sally. Each twelve-minute slot can be shared with one other person, couple, or family. A zoom ID and password will be sent to those who RSVP by noon on the day of the visitation. 

If slots become full, email the family, and we will add additional times or days.  If you have any difficulty signing up on the Sign-Up Genius site or need help, email Stacia at stewardgroup@gmail.com for assistance.
