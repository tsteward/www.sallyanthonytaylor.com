A Memorial Service will be held for Sally at the Heartland Baptist Church in Ames on June 19th at 2 pm Central Standard Time.  Because of COVID, the gathering will be limited to family members only.  

Unfortunately we will not be able to stream Sally’s memorial service for live viewing as previously planned, but the service will be recorded, and we will post a link for viewing the service on this page soon after the service.

Link to view Sally’s Memorial Service:  Coming soon!
