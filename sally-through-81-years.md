**In Christ Alone**   
In Christ alone my hope is found;  
He is my light, my strength, my song;  
This cornerstone, this solid ground,  
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.  

What heights of love, what depths of peace,  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!  
My comforter, my all in all—  
Here in the love of Christ I stand.  

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,  
Fullness of God in helpless babe!  
This gift of love and righteousness,  
Scorned by the ones He came to save.  

Till on that cross as Jesus died,  
The wrath of God was satisfied;  
For ev’ry sin on Him was laid—  
Here in the death of Christ I live.  

There in the ground His body lay,  
Light of the world by darkness slain;  
Then bursting forth in glorious day,  
Up from the grave He rose again!  

And as He stands in victory,  
Sin’s curse has lost its grip on me;  
For I am His and He is mine—  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.  

No guilt in life, no fear in death—  
This is the pow’r of Christ in me;  
From life’s first cry to final breath,  
Jesus commands my destiny.  

No pow’r of hell, no scheme of man,  
Can ever pluck me from His hand;  
Till He returns or calls me home—  
Here in the pow’r of Christ I’ll stand.  

**It is Not Death to Die**  
It is not death to die  
To leave this weary road  
And join the saints who dwell on high  
Who’ve found their home with God  
It is not death to close  
The eyes long dimmed by tears  
And wake in joy before Your throne  
Delivered from our fears  

O Jesus, conquering the grave  
Your precious blood has power to save  
Those who trust in You  
Will in Your mercy find  
That it is not death to die  

It is not death to fling  
Aside this earthly dust  
And rise with strong and noble wing  
To live among the just  
It is not death to hear  
The key unlock the door  
That sets us free from mortal years  
To praise You evermore
