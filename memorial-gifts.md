In lieu of flowers, the family requests that memorial contributions be made to Bethany Lutheran College, the school where Sally received her high school education. Today, it functions as a Christian liberal arts college--offering 60 majors, minors, and other programs. More information on BLC can be found at [https://blc.edu/] Checks can be written to “Bethany Lutheran College” with “Sally Taylor Memorial” written in the memo section and sent c/o Don Taylor, 3516 Woodland St, Ames, IA  50014.
